## Code Explanation:-
The code implements a simple number guessing game in Java. A random number is generated 
within a specified range (1 to 100), and the player has up to 5 attempts to guess it. 
After each guess, the program gives feedback if the guess is too high or low. If the 
guess is correct, the player earns points based on the number of remaining attempts. 
The player can choose to play multiple rounds, and the final score is displayed when 
they quit. The game loops until the player opts out, with the score accumulating across 
rounds.
